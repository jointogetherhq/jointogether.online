- **Conditional questions** – tailor the journey to each applicant with branching logic
- **Perfect rate calculations** - take accurate membership fees based on **your** rules
- **Flexible payment methods** - offer appropriate and secure payment options for members with Direct Debit & Deduction at Source

<!-- Talk about how great the experience is for all -->
## A seamless online join experience for all members

Our forms aren’t just functional, they’re designed to delight.

- **Fast and simple** – simplify applications for your members. One thing per page. More finished applications
- **Mobile-first, desktop-ready** – give your members a smooth, reliable experience on any device
- **Fully accessible** – meet web accessibility standards – _everyone_ can **Join**
- **Beautifully branded** – integrate seamlessly with your website for a consistent look
{:.flaticon-list.list-2}

A better join form means more members and less admin. By removing friction, more people complete their applications,
helping your union grow. At the same time, smarter forms capture more accurate data, reducing processing time and costs.

built from the ground up to help unions meet their data protection responsibilities with confidence.

- **GDPR-compliant** – lawful, fair, and transparent data processing

  <h2>Update:Upgrade — the simpler way to keep member data up to date</h2>

  <p>
    Outdated and inaccurate member data is a costly headache for unions. It wastes time, drains resources, and makes organising harder:
  </p>

  <ul class="flaticon-list list-5">
    <li><strong>Ballots go undelivered</strong>, reducing turnout and wasting money</li>
    <li><strong>Poor communication frustrates members</strong>, weakening engagement and increasing churn</li>
    <li><strong>Staff waste hours chasing updates</strong>, instead of focusing on organising and servicing members</li>
    <li><strong>Incorrect records mean lost revenue</strong>, from members paying the wrong subs or not paying at all</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Keeping member data up to date isn’t just admin — it’s essential for a stronger, more effective union.
  </p>

  <h3>Member Portals Don’t Work</h3>

  <p>
    Many unions have member portals or login areas, but they often go unused. They’re clunky, slow, and frustrating, leaving members disengaged.
  </p>

  <p>
    One union we work with found that <em>“forgot password”</em> was the <strong>second most visited page</strong> on their website—a clear sign of frustration. Worse, when unions urgently need accurate data (such as before a ballot), they scramble to update records with mass emails, calls, and spreadsheets, overloading staff and delaying critical work.
  </p>

  <h3>Meet Update:Upgrade, the hassle-free and cost-effective way to maintain up-to-date member data</h3>

  <p>
    We built <strong>Update:Upgrade</strong> to make keeping member data up-to-date effortless. It’s a simple, secure,
    and easy-to-use web service that lets members update their own details in seconds.
  </p>

  <ul class="flaticon-list list-6">
    <li><strong>Members update their own details in seconds</strong> – reduce team admin. Updates are instant and secure</li>
    <li><strong>Better engagement, stronger organising</strong> – stay accurate. Reduce member frustration</li>
    <li><strong>Lower costs, higher retention</strong>– minimise wasted resources and lost revenue</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The NEU is using <strong>Update:Upgrade</strong> to enable student members to automatically update their records
    and upgrade their membership as they move into teaching, helping them retain more members while drastically cutting
    costs and manual processing.
