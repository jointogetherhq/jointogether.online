## Join Together helps unions get more members&nbsp;by:

- Turning effective workplace organising and great campaigns into more members by making it quick and easy for people to join.
- Giving prospective members a great first impression of joining a union.
- Reducing member attrition and increasing revenue, by making it straightforward for people to update their contact information, payment details and their subs rate.
- Being designed and built for unions, fully hosted, secure, scalable and continually optimised to get better and better over time.
- Being built by a team who actually get unions.
