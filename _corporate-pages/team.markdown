We started Join Together as a co-operative with a focus on helping unions address the technology challenges we've seen them face over the years. And though we’re not “organisers” in the traditional sense (well, one of us is!) , we’ve come to see ourselves playing a similar role.

Our mission is to make it easier to join – and stay a member of – unions. We created software that gives people a better online joining experience to help unions recruit more members, get bigger – and win.
