Join Together is a worker-led co-operative, and a member of Co-Operatives UK.

The co-op is owned equally by its members who run the enterprise together as democratic equals. Our values and vision are encapsulated into our founding articles which proudly state that our objective is to focus on “increasing trade union membership in the UK and around the world”.

Being a cooperative means we all work in a healthier, more collaborative and less stressful environment. It means we're all building something together, for each other, for the union movement, and not for the benefit of a small group of investors. When we expand, future employees will own and run Join Together with us. We believe this model is the future of our industry and beyond.
