It shouldn’t be hard to join a union. So Join Together:

- Offers a simple and accessible application process
- Only asks for what you need to know
- Only shows the steps the member needs to see
- Uses words anyone can understand
- Makes it quick and respects people’s time
- Lets people pay for their membership in the way that suits them best
- Helps people recruit their colleagues
- Works as well on a phone as a computer
