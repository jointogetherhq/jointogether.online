It shouldn’t be hard to join a union. So Join Together:

- Offers a really simple application process.
- Only asks for what you need to know.
- Only shows the steps the member needs to see.
- Uses words anyone can understand.
- Makes it quick and respect people’s time.
- Lets people pay for their membership in the way that suits them best.
- Helps people recruit their colleagues.

5. Payment via Direct Debit, deduction at source and card (coming soon)
6. Automated “resume application” feature for people who don’t join in one sitting.
