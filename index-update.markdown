<!-- Start with focus on our current headline feature: drastic improvement in conversion -->
## Conversion-optimised online join for your union

We design, develop and deliver the gold standard in online join forms for our union partners and the results speak for
themselves:

<!-- Talk a bit about being user and user-experience focused -->
How do we do this? By designing and building **forms so simple applicants glide to the end without ever having to
think**. And we do this whilst still capturing all the information you need to onboard your new members.

<!-- Make it clear we that it doesn't come at the expense of the union's data capture/calculation needs -->
Whether it’s employer or sector-specific questions, complex rate calculation rules, political levies, deduction at
source, or Direct Debit, our **Join platform is designed to adapt to the precise needs of your union**.

<!-- Talk about how great the experience is for all -->
## Online join that delights members, whatever their needs

As well as working **perfectly across mobile and desktop**, our forms are designed to **meet the highest standard of web
accessibility guidelines**, ensuring *everyone* is able to join your union online, no matter what their particular access
needs are.

They also look beautiful, and are fully customised to fit with your brand and website, ensuring a seamless onboarding
experience for your new members.

<!-- CRM/process integration is another key thing to sell/convince on -->
## Seamless integration with your CRM and processes

The membership database sits at the heart of a union and it's organising and servicing functions. At Join Together we
understand this, and have designed our Join platform to **work in perfect harmony with existing CRMs**, so you maintain
all your existing processes and data management policies. Whether you're using **Salesforce**, **Dynamics365**, **APT
Stratum**, **iMIS** or something completely different,... [MORE WORDS].

And when it comes time to migrate to another CRM, the Join Together system is ready to migrate with you, without the
need for a risky, costly and complex rebuild of the form.

<!-- A bit of a grab bag about security, performance and hosting... -->
## A fully hosted, maintained and secure service

We support and maintain the Join platform so you don’t have to, ensuring it’s always **up to date, secure, and
available** when your members need it. Automatic encryption and banking-grade security keeps application data safe
in a secure, access-managed location.

Not only is the Join platform designed and built to be secure, but it’s also **lightning fast** to use,
automatically scaling up to remain online and responsive, even during busy periods.

## Fair, transparent, union-friendly pricing

We charge a one-time initial design and implementation fee, then a fixed monthly subscription to cover ongoing
operations and support. Pricing is based on the expected number of monthly applications: smaller unions with fewer
resources pay less; larger ones who use more, pay more, just like they would in a union!
