<!-- Start with focus on our current headline feature: drastic improvement in conversion -->
## Conversion-optimised online join for your union

We design, develop, and deliver high-performing online join forms that help unions grow. The results speak for
themselves:

<!-- Talk a bit about being user and user-experience focused -->
How do we achieve this? By crafting frictionless forms that guide applicants effortlessly to completion while still
capturing all the essential information your union needs.

The **Join** platform adapts to your specific needs, whether that includes:

<ul class="emoji-list list-1">
  <li><strong>Conditional questions and branching logic</strong> — tailoring the journey to each applicant</li>
  <li><strong>Complex rate calculations</strong> — ensuring accurate membership fees based on rules you define</li>
  <li><strong>Direct Debit and Deduction at Source</strong> — offering appropriate and secure payment options for members</li>
  <li><strong>Political levies</strong> — handling optional opt-ins with ease</li>
</ul>

Whatever the particular peculiarities of your union, **Join** can handle them without a sweat.

<!-- More social proof (tbc) — do we need this to have a specific focus? -->

  <blockquote>Join Together have played a pivotal role in helping the union grow over the last few years, and continue
  to be a key partner for us.</blockquote>

<!-- Talk about how great the experience is for all -->
## A seamless online join experience for all members

Our forms aren’t just functional, they’re designed to delight:

<ul class="emoji-list list-2">
  <li><strong>Optimised for speed and simplicity</strong> — guiding users effortlessly from start to finish</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile-friendly and desktop-ready</strong> — ensuring a smooth experience on any device</li>
  <li><strong>Fully accessible</strong> — meeting web accessibility standards so everyone can join</li>
  <li><strong>Beautifully branded</strong> — seamlessly integrating with your website for a consistent look</li>
</ul>

A better join form means more members and less admin. By removing friction, more people complete their applications,
helping your union grow. At the same time, smarter forms capture more accurate data, reducing processing time and costs.

Your membership database is the backbone of your union’s organising and servicing. That’s why the **Join** platform
integrates seamlessly with your existing CRM, keeping your processes intact.

<ul class="emoji-list list-3">
  <li><strong>Works with your current system</strong> — integrates with Salesforce, Dynamics 365, APT Stratum, iMIS, and more</li>
  <li><strong>Real-time data syncing</strong> — ensuring accurate records and smooth processing of applications</li>

<!-- A bit of a grab bag about security, performance and hosting... -->
## Security and data protection at its core

We know unions handle sensitive member data and have strict legal obligations. That’s why the **Join** platform is
built from the ground up to help unions meet their data protection responsibilities with confidence.

<ul class="emoji-list list-4">
  <li><strong>GDPR-compliant by design</strong> — ensuring lawful, fair, and transparent data processing</li>
  <li><strong>Full control</strong> — clear retention policies and automated redaction to protect member privacy</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy-first architecture</strong> — secure storage, controlled access, and security audits</li>
  <li><strong>End-to-end encryption</strong> — application data is encrypted in transit and at rest for maximum security</li>
  <li><strong>EU-based hosting</strong> — all data is stored on secure EU servers, ensuring compliance with data residency requirements</li>
</ul>

With **Join** your union can be confident that every application is handled securely, responsibly, and in compliance
with data protection laws.

  <h2>Update:Upgrade — the simpler way to keep member data up-to-date</h2>

  <p>
    Outdated and inaccurate member data is a costly headache for unions. It wastes time, drains resources, and makes organising harder:
  </p>

  <ul class="emoji-list list-5">
    <li><strong>Ballots go undelivered</strong> — reducing turnout and wasting money</li>
    <li><strong>Poor communication frustrates members</strong> — weakening engagement and increasing the risk of churn</li>
    <li><strong>Staff waste hours chasing updates</strong> — instead of focusing on organising and servicing members</li>
    <li><strong>Incorrect records mean lost revenue</strong> — from members paying the wrong subs or not paying at all</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Keeping member data up-to-date isn’t just admin — it’s essential for a stronger, more effective union.
  </p>

  <h3>Member Portals Don’t Work</h3>

  <p>
    Many unions have member portals or login areas, but they often go unused. They’re clunky, slow, and frustrating, leaving members disengaged.
  </p>

  <p>
    One union we work with found that <em>“forgot password”</em> was the <strong>second most visited page</strong> on their website—a clear sign of frustration. Worse, when unions urgently need accurate data (such as before a ballot), they scramble to update records with mass emails, calls, and spreadsheets, overloading staff and delaying critical work.
  </p>

  <h3>Meet Update:Upgrade — The hassle-free and cost-effective way to maintain up-to-date member data</h3>

  <p>
    We built <strong>Update:Upgrade</strong> to make keeping member data up-to-date effortless. It’s a simple, secure, and easy-to-use web service that lets members update their own details in seconds.
  </p>

  <ul class="emoji-list list-6">
    <li><strong>Members update their own details in seconds</strong> — updates happen instantly, reducing admin for your team</li>
    <li><strong>Better engagement, stronger organising</strong> — keeping your records fresh and accurate</li>
    <li><strong>Lower costs, higher retention</strong> — minimising wasted resources and lost revenue</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The NEU is using <strong>Update:Upgrade</strong> to enable student members to automatically update their records
    and upgrade their membership as they move into teaching, helping them retain more members while drastically cutting
    costs and manual processing.
