## What makes Join Together so special?

Our tools are **the gold standard for unions who want to help members join easily, then keep their details up to date
over time**. More members and better quality data = stronger unions.

Here are five reasons your union should use the Join Together platform:

### 1. Membership services that help you recruit and retain more members

We work with you to sweat the details so your online join gets you more members: 60% of applicants that start a Join
Together join form go on to submit their application. How many extra members would your union have with a form that
converted that well?

Our **“update your details”** service is a passwordless process that allows members to update their job, salary, address
and more in just a few seconds, ensuring better member data and rate accuracy, higher engagement and better member
retention.

We handle everything unions need: employer-specific questions and lookups, subs rate calculations, deduction at
source and Direct Debits - and our platform adapts to your requirements.

### 2. Seamless integration with your existing CRM, processes and website

Join Together lives in harmony with your existing membership system, and feeds new applications directly into your CRM
ready for your membership team to process. Includes Salesforce, Dynamics365, APT Stratum and more.

Our tools are customised to fit with your brand and website, ensuring a seamless experience for members. They also work
perfectly across mobile and desktop and are **accessible** and **inclusive by default**.

### 3. Fast, hosted, and maintained, with data ethics and security as standard

We support and maintain the Join Together platform so you don’t have to, ensuring it’s always **up to date, secure, and
available** when your members need it. Automatic encryption and banking-grade security keeps application data safe
in a secure, access-managed location. [Learn more about our security](/information-security).

Not only is the Join Together platform designed and built to be secure, but it’s also **lightning fast** to use,
automatically scaling up to remain online and responsive, even during busy periods.

### 4. Fair, transparent, union-friendly pricing

We charge a one-time initial design and implementation fee, then a fixed monthly subscription to cover ongoing
operations and support. Pricing is based on the expected number of monthly applications: smaller unions with fewer
resources pay less; larger ones who use more, pay more, just like they would in a union!

### 5. Brought to you by a team that cares about unions

Join Together Co-operative are technologists with a passion for the union movement, with decades of collective
experience delivering world class digital services. [Learn more about the team](/team).
