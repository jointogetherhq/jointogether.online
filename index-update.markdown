<!-- Start with focus on our current headline feature: drastic improvement in conversion -->
## Conversion-optimised online join for your union

We design, develop and deliver the gold standard in online join forms for our union partners and the results speak for
themselves:

  <blockquote>There's been a 60% improvement in completion rates for our online join. We couldn't be happier.</blockquote>

<!-- Talk a bit about being user and user-experience focused -->
How do we do this? By designing and building **forms so simple applicants glide to the end without ever having to
think**. And we do this whilst still capturing all the information you need to onboard your new members.

<!-- Make it clear we that it doesn't come at the expense of the union's data capture/calculation needs -->
Whether it’s employer or sector-specific questions, complex rate calculation rules, political levies, deduction at
source, or Direct Debit, our **Join platform is designed to adapt to the precise needs of your union**.

<!-- Talk about how great the experience is for all -->
## Online join that delights members, whatever their needs

As well as working **perfectly across mobile and desktop**, our forms are designed to **meet the highest standard of web
accessibility guidelines**, ensuring *everyone* is able to join your union online, no matter what their particular access
needs are.

They also look beautiful, and are fully customised to fit with your brand and website, ensuring a seamless onboarding
experience for your new members.

<!-- CRM/process integration is another key thing to sell/convince on -->
## Seamless integration with your CRM and processes

Your membership database is the backbone of your union’s organising and servicing. That’s why we built the **Join**
platform to **seamlessly integrate with your existing CRM**, so you can keep your current processes and data management
policies intact. Whether you use **Salesforce**, **Dynamics 365**, **APT Stratum**, **iMIS**, or another system,
**Join** will work in sync with it to ensure accurate data capture and smooth processing of applications.

And if you ever switch CRMs, there’s no need for a costly, complex rebuild. The **Join** platform moves with you,
keeping your data flowing smoothly, without the risk or hassle of starting over.

<!-- A bit of a grab bag about security, performance and hosting... -->
## A secure, fully hosted, and hassle-free service

We support and maintain the **Join** platform so you don’t have to, ensuring it’s always **up to date, secure, and
available** when your members need it. Automatic encryption and banking-grade security keeps application data safe
in a secure, access-managed location.

Designed for both **speed and reliability**, the Join platform scales automatically to handle high demand, ensuring a
seamless experience even during peak times.

## Fair, transparent, union-friendly pricing

We charge a one-time initial design and implementation fee, then a fixed monthly subscription to cover ongoing
operations and support. Pricing is based on the expected number of monthly applications: smaller unions with fewer
resources pay less; larger ones who use more, pay more, just like they would in a union!
