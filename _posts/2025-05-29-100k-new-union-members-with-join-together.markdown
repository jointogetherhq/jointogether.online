[Last October we passed 50,000 people joining unions through Join Together's platform](https://jointogether.online/post/2024-10-09-fifty-thousand-new-union-members/). 

Earlier this month we crossed the 100,000 threshold - and it's speeding up as we continue to optimise every step of joining a union online.

Want to know what we mean by that? Well, learn how we [improved the NEU's online join completion by 60%](https://jointogether.online/post/2025-03-13-neu-online-join-case-study/) or [how "seeing yourself" in an employer list can increase the number of people signing up by 15%](https://jointogether.online/post/2025-05-15-how-seeing-yourself-helps-increase-conversion-up-to-15%25/).

2025 is a big year for the UK's unions. The Government's Employment Rights Bill includes lots of good things, including workplace and virtual organising access for unions, both of which will help improve union recruitment in future years. 

For us, that means it's the right time to invest in maximising the returns to this new organising work, by improving the effectiveness of your union's join form and making sure that every interaction with a prospective member is more likely to result in them becoming an actual member.
