*“If you break down everything you can think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.”*  - Dave Brailsford, the coach who turned British cycling into a world-beating force.

Let’s imagine a union with some fairly typical online joining stats.

On average, 5000 people take a look at the “join us” page of their website each month and 1000 actually join (so the “conversion rate” of the online join process is 20%). It costs £15/month (on average) to be a member.

What happens if you can optimise that process to increase the conversion rate for joining online from 20% to 21%?

Well, after one year, you have 600 additional members and almost £60,000 in additional subs.

After two years, you’ve doubled that to 1200 additional members, but now you have £225,000 in additional subs.

By the end of the third year, you have 1800 more members and £500k more membership fees.

All for a 1% improvement in conversion rate.

So, the question is - how do you get there?

Here are some ideas:

First, build a better form. Make it quick and easy to complete by asking only for what’s necessary and doing so in a logical order.

Second, make it work for more people. Is your form accessible? Does it work beautifully on mobile? Does it load fast? Does it work well on devices with less power?

Third, make it easy to refer people. If colleagues can easily refer colleagues, you increase the number of people seeing a form that’s relevant to them. This makes it more likely they’ll complete it.

Fourth, remind people who get distracted, or forget to complete their application ([that one’s worth a 1% improvement on its own](/post/2022-05-29-do-now-or-do-later)).

Lastly, make it fast and reliable. Use a cloud service with high availability and plenty of power to scale to any time periods when lots of people are joining.

Or [just talk to us](https://calendly.com/join-together/hello), because Join Together does all that, and mo out of the box.
