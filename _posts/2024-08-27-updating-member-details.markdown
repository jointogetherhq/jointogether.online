Out-of-date member data is one of the major pains unions have to deal with:

- Not having correct addresses impacts the ability to ballot effectively
- Inaccurate/out-of-date subs not only costs the union money, but also leads to disappointed members when they cannot receive the support they need because they've been paying the wrong rate
- Incorrect workplace information makes organising more difficult
- Not being able to stay in touch with members leads to lower engagement and ultimately lower retention

## How unions try to fix it

We’ve worked with many unions over the years and heard about this pain, as well as the difficulties they have trying to keep their member data up-to-date. We’ve seen them try a variety of approaches, including:

- Paper forms through the post
- Direct phone calls
- Online forms that save the data to spreadsheets
- Asking members to log-in to a membership portal to update their info

Each of these methods comes with challenges. Calls and paper forms are expensive to make/send, get low response rates, and in the case of paper forms require a lot of manual and often error-prone processing.

Collecting information via spreadsheets often lead to enormous data protection risks, as well as problems with data entry, as files are passed from person to person, computer to computer, usually ending with a messy import or copy/paste/fix-the-mistakes process, slowing the whole thing down.

Finally, membership portals are rarely a smooth ride for members, requiring them to recall information like membership numbers and passwords that they probably won't have to hand, and if they do, the user experience in these portals is rarely smooth and simple, and it's no surprise that so few members overcome the hurdles and actually update their details.

It's not a surprise that so many unions struggle with keeping member data updated.

## There's a better way

Join Together has created a solution for unions enabling members to update their own details that:

1. needs no login, but is still completely secure
2. is cheap and easy to get members to use
3. is intuitive, taking members less than a minute to complete
4. can recalculate subscription rates when member's circumstances change
5. updates member records in the CRM automatically, without the need for manual entry

Once a union has our ‘update your details’ service in place, they can send periodic or targetted emails and texts to members reminding them to keep their information updated (we recommend you do it about once a year).

## Try it for yourself
