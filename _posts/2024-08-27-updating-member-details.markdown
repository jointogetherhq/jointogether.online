We’ve worked with unions for years, and heard all sorts of horror stories about the difficulties of staying in touch with members. To try and fix this, we’ve seen unions taking a variety of approaches. These include:

- Asking for updated details by post or phone
- Collecting information via forms or spreadsheets, usually just before a ballot takes place
- Getting members to log in to a membership portal on the union website

Each of these has different challenges and costs. Calls and letters are expensive to make or send, get low response rates and often interrupt what members are doing at a particular moment (”I’ll do that later” and “who’s that number calling me?”). 

Collecting information via spreadsheets leads to enormous data protection risks, as well as problems with data entry, as files are passed from person to person, computer to computer, usually ending with a messy import or copy/paste/fix the mistakes process, slowing the whole thing down.

Finally, union membership portals are challenging for their users. The typical experience involves using data members probably don’t know (their membership number or a password they never use, leading to a password reset or an email to the membership team) before logging into a piece of software they’re unfamiliar with to perform a task they can’t be sure they’ll be able to complete.

### How could it be better?

Join Together has created a solution for members to update their own details that:

1. Needs no login, but is still completely secure
2. Is cheap and easy to get members to use
3. Is intuitive, only taking members a few seconds to complete
4. Can recalculate subscription rates based on the members’ current salary or circumstances
5. Updates your membership database/CRM automatically

Once you’ve got an improved ‘update your details’ service in place, you just need to send occasional emails or texts to members to remind them to keep their information updated (we recommend you do it about once a year). You can also include links on your website and other materials so members can update their record whenever convenient.

### Try it for yourself

We’ve put together a [demo](https://https://jtreview-pr-1167.herokuapp.com) so you can see how it works. Just add your email (your details won’t be stored) to get started, then try the update process for yourself.

- Better, more frequent contact and engagement with members
- Higher revenue from more accurate member subs
- Improved member retention
- Happier members, because they can complete this task more easily
