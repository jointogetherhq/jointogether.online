Having out-of-date member data is a major challenge unions face.

Impacts include:

- Having the wrong addresses for members, making effective balloting impossible
- Inaccurate subs payments costing the union money, and members the support they need
- Making organising harder, because unions don't know the member density in a workplace
- Being unable to stay in touch with members, leading to reduced engagement and retention

## How unions try to fix it

We’ve worked with many unions over the years and regularly hear about this pain, as well as how hard it is to try to keep member data up-to-date. We’ve seen a variety of approaches, including:

- Sending members paper forms through the post
- Calling them directly
- Creating online forms that save members' data to spreadsheets
- Asking members to log-in to a membership portal to update their info

None of these is a great solution. 

Calls and paper forms are expensive to make or send, tend to get low response rates, and in the case of paper forms require a lot of manual and often error-prone processing. Collecting information via spreadsheets causes real data protection risks, as well as problems with data entry, as files are passed from person to person, computer to computer, usually ending with a messy import or slow copy/paste/fix-the-mistakes process.

Finally, membership portals are rarely a smooth ride for members, usually requiring them to recall their membership number and password (they probably won't have these to hand). And if they do make it in, the user experience in these portals is rarely smooth and simple, and it's no surprise that so few members overcome the hurdles and actually update their details.

It's therefore no surprise unions struggle to keep member data up to date.

## There's a better way

Join Together has created a solution for unions that lets members update their own details.

It:

1. Needs no login, but is still completely secure
2. Is cheap and easy to get members to use
3. Is intuitive, taking members less than a minute to complete
4. Can recalculate subscription rates when a member's circumstances change
5. Updates member records in the CRM automatically, without the need for manual entry

Once a union has our ‘update your details’ service in place, they can send periodic or targeted emails and texts to members reminding them to keep their information updated (we recommend you do this about once a year).

## Try it for yourself

We’ve put together a **[demo version](https://demo-update.jointogether.online)** so you can see the experience for yourself. Just enter your email and check your inbox for the verification email to get started.
