As of today over 50,000 people have joined a union using one of our online joining forms ðŸŽ‰. That number is rising
rapidly as we work with more unions: 36,000 of those joined this year alone.

And then there's the thousands of existing members that will be keeping their membership current using our new [update-your-details system](/post/2024-08-27-updating-member-details/).

Thanks to [the TUC](https://www.tuc.org.uk) for supporting Join Together.
