Every person that doesn’t get to the end of your union's online join form is a potential new member lost. But have you ever calculated what that costs the union? The maths is pretty straightforward:

**average cost of monthly membership * 12 months * average years of membership**

So say your members pay on average of £13 a month and stay a member for an average of 10 years. That would mean every potential member that fails to get to the end of your online join will cost the union £1,560. And if 20 potential members fail to reach the end each month? That'll be £31,200 of potential membership fees lost every single month.

### How much more money could your union make by improving the online join experience?

We can frame this question another way: What would a small improvement in our online join experience mean for your union’s income?

Using the same maths, if improvements to your online join mean an extra 20 members join each month, that's worth an extra £31,200 to your union every single month!

A better way to think about this is with conversion rates. What percentage of applicants that start their application online actually get to the end?

You should be measuring this with analytics tooling like [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) or even better, the more privacy-friendly [Plausible](https://plausible.io). If your current online join has a completion rate of 40% and you sign up 200 members a month, you only need to improving your online join by 4% to net those extra 20 members (£31,200) each month. Even a 1% improvement in conversion would mean an £7,800 extra subs for your union.

Our online join forms have an average completion rate of 60% across a range of industries. We sweat the details to maximise the chance that anyone starting an application will get to the end. How much more would your union be making if your online join performed this well? [Speaking to us](https://calendly.com/join-together/hello) and stop leaving money on the table.
